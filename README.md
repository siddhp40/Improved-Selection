# Smart-Clipboard

Smart clipboard is a simple chrome extension to change the functionality of the clipboard. "Copy" still works as intended but a new hotkey of Ctrl+Shift+V is added to instead add selected elements to a stack. Furthermore, the user can view & chance their clipboard by clicking on the extension. 

## Hotkey

To change the hotkey visit chrome://extensions and click on "Keyboard Shortcut" to change the hotkey.

## Privacy

Smart Clipboard does not collect any data or personal information, Any user settings will be saved locally.
